## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React (TypeScript)](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Continued development

Plain old CSS in components as a styling method in react projects becomes hard to manage as the project scales, causing name collitions with class names among React Components, in the future I will try other styling methods in react such as Styled Components or CSS Modules.
